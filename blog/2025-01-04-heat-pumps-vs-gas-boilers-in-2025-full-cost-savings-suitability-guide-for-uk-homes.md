Blog 4 – Heat Pumps vs Gas Boilers in 2025

# Heat Pumps vs Gas Boilers in 2025: Full Cost, Savings & Suitability Guide for UK Homes

Heat pumps have become one of the most talked‑about home upgrades in the UK. With government incentives, rising gas prices, and increasing interest in low‑carbon heating, homeowners want to know one thing:

## **Is a heat pump actually cheaper — or even suitable — for my home in 2025?**

This complete guide compares heat pumps and gas boilers in:
- upfront cost  
- running cost  
- lifetime savings  
- suitability for UK property types  
- maintenance  
- efficiency  
- practical considerations  
- integration with home insulation  
- integration with smart tariffs  
- long‑term value  

It’s written in clear English for the average UK homeowner — and includes practical examples and cost modelling your **Cost Saver App** can later automate.

## 1. Heat Pumps vs Gas Boilers: The Quick Summary

| Feature | Heat Pump | Gas Boiler |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Upfront cost | £4,000–£12,000 (after grants) | £2,000–£3,500 |
| Running cost | Often cheaper with smart tariffs | Usually cheaper on standard tariffs |
| Efficiency | 250–450% | 80–94% |
| Lifespan | 15–20 years | 10–12 years |
| Best for | Well‑insulated homes | Most UK homes |
| Works with radiators? | Yes, but may need upgrades | Yes |
| Carbon emissions | Very low | High |
| Maintenance | Low | Medium |
| Noise | External fan (40–55 dB) | Minimal |

Heat pumps win long‑term on efficiency and low‑carbon performance, but suitability depends on insulation, radiator size, and tariff pricing.

## 2. Costs of Installation (2025 Updated)

### **Heat Pump Costs**
- Air‑source heat pump: £7,000–£12,000  
- Ground‑source heat pump: £14,000–£22,000  

### **Boiler Upgrade Scheme Grant**
Government offers:
- **£7,500 off air‑source heat pumps**  
- **£7,500 off ground‑source**

### **Realistic homeowner contribution (after grant):**
- **£4,000–£5,000** (air‑source)  
- **£7,000–£12,000** (ground‑source)

### **Gas Boiler Costs**
- New combi boiler: £2,000–£3,500  
- System boiler: £2,500–£4,000  
- Installation: 1 day (vs 3–5 days for heat pump)

**Conclusion:** Boilers remain cheaper upfront, but heat pumps become competitive over time.

-----

## 3. Running Cost Comparison (2025 Prices)

### **Gas Boiler Running Cost**
- Gas at ~6p per kWh  
- Boiler efficiency ~85–94%

Heating a home requiring 12,000 kWh of heat →  
You’d burn ~14,000 kWh of gas → **£840/year**

### **Heat Pump Running Cost**
- Uses electricity instead of gas  
- COP (efficiency): 2.5–4.0  
- Electricity ~23–29p/kWh (can be cheaper off‑peak)

For 12,000 kWh of heat →  
You’d use ~4,000–5,000 kWh electricity →  
**£1,000–£1,300/year standard tariff**  
**£550–£850/year smart EV tariff**

### **Tariff makes the difference.**

Heat pumps are cheapest **only** if:
- you use smart tariffs  
- or your home is highly insulated  
- or you have solar/battery support  

-----

## 4. Heat Pump Suitability Checklist (2025)

A heat pump is suitable if:

### ✔ Home insulation is good
EPC rating C or above is ideal.

### ✔ Radiators are large enough
Low‑flow temperatures (35–50°C) require bigger radiators.

### ✔ You have outdoor space
A unit roughly the size of a large suitcase.

### ✔ You don’t rely on extremely high heat output
Heat pumps provide steady, gentle heat.

### ✔ You’re on or willing to switch to a smart tariff
Critical for savings.

If 3 or more of these boxes **aren’t** ticked, a heat pump may not be cost‑effective **yet**.

-----

## 5. Boiler Suitability Checklist

A modern gas boiler remains a better choice if:

### ✔ Your home loses heat quickly  
Poor insulation → heat pumps struggle.

### ✔ You want fast, high‑temperature heating  
Gas boilers excel at rapid heating.

### ✔ You want the lowest upfront cost  
Boilers are far cheaper initially.

### ✔ You have limited radiator space  
Oversized radiators may not fit smaller rooms.

### ✔ You’re not ready to switch to smart electricity tariffs

## 6. Case Studies (UK Realistic Examples)

### **Case Study A – 3‑Bed Semi, Good Insulation**
- Annual heat demand: 11,000 kWh  
- Heat pump COP: 3.2  
- Electricity off‑peak: 12p/kWh  
- On‑peak: 30p  

**Heat pump annual cost:** ~£780  
**Gas boiler annual cost:** ~£830  

→ Heat pump slightly cheaper + lower carbon.

-----

### **Case Study B – Victorian Terrace, Poor Insulation**
- Annual demand: 16,000 kWh  
- Heat pump COP drops to 2.2  
- Heat pump electricity cost: ~£1,700  
- Gas boiler: ~£950  

→ Heat pump more expensive until insulation improves.

-----

### **Case Study C – Home With EV + Solar**
- Uses cheap overnight EV tariff  
- Solar exports offset daytime electricity  

→ Heat pump becomes **far cheaper** than gas.

-----

## 7. Maintenance & Reliability

### Heat Pump
- Service once every 1–2 years  
- Few moving parts  
- Typical lifespan: 15–20 years  

### Gas Boiler
- Annual servicing required  
- More components that can fail  
- Lifespan: 10–12 years  

Heat pumps win on reliability, especially long-term.

-----

## 8. Environmental Impact

Heat pumps reduce carbon emissions dramatically because:
- they use electricity (which is increasingly renewable)  
- they produce 3–4× more heat than energy consumed  

Gas boilers still produce high CO₂ per kWh.

By 2035, gas boilers may face stricter regulations.

-----

## 9. Heat Pumps + Smart Tariffs = Huge Savings

Smart tariffs like:
- Intelligent Octopus  
- OVO Charge Anytime  
- Octopus Cosy  
- Agile Octopus  

Offer:
- overnight rates as low as 7–12p/kWh  
- dynamic pricing for efficiency  

A heat pump running overnight or during low‑cost windows can cost **half** that of gas boilers.

-----

## 10. How the Cost Saver App Helps You Decide

Your app simplifies the decision with:

### ✔ Home suitability scoring  
Based on insulation, EPC rating, property type.

### ✔ Annual heating cost modelling  
Comparing gas vs heat pump costs.

### ✔ Tariff‑based calculations

## Final Thoughts

Heat pumps are not a universal solution — but they are a powerful, efficient, future-proof upgrade when conditions are right.  
Gas boilers remain cost‑effective for many homes, especially poorly insulated ones.

The key is **knowing which option suits your home best**, based on:
- insulation  
- property age  
- tariff  
- lifestyle  
- heating patterns  

With the Cost Saver App’s personalised modelling, homeowners can make the smartest choice in 2025 — one that balances comfort, cost, and long‑term value.
