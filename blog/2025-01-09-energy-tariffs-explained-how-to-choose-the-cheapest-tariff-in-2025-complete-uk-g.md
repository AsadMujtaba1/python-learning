# Energy Tariffs Explained: How to Choose the Cheapest Tariff in 2025 (Complete UK Guide)

Energy tariffs in the UK have become increasingly complex. Between standard variable tariffs, fixed deals, smart tariffs, EV tariffs, and export payments, most households no longer know which tariff is genuinely the cheapest for them. This guide explains everything in simple English, with real examples and clear cost comparisons. It also highlights how the Cost Saver App helps you choose the best tariff based on your actual usage, not guesswork.

---

## 1. Why Choosing the Right Tariff Matters More Than Ever in 2025

Energy prices remain volatile. The Ofgem price cap updates quarterly, smart tariffs can change daily, and EV tariffs now dominate the market. Picking the wrong tariff can cost households **£150–£600 per year**.

Key reasons tariff selection matters:

- standing charges are historically high

- electricity usage is increasing due to EVs & heat pumps

- smart meters allow new tariff types

- regional pricing differences remain wide

- many households stay on uncompetitive SVTs

Understanding tariff types is the first step to cutting your bill.

## 2. The Main Tariff Types in the UK (2025)

### **1. Standard Variable Tariff (SVT)**

- This is the default tariff if you haven’t switched.

- Prices follow the Ofgem price cap.

- No exit fees.

- Can increase or decrease every 3 months.

**Good for:** flexibility

**Bad for:** long-term stability

**Price-wise:** usually not the cheapest

---

### **2. Fixed Tariffs**

- Price locked for 12–24 months.

- Protects you from rising bills.

- Exit fees often apply.

**Good for:** budgeting, stability

**Bad for:** if prices fall after you fix

**Price-wise:** competitive when suppliers expect rises

---

### **3. Time-of-Use Tariffs**

Tariffs where electricity prices change based on the time of day.

Examples:

- Octopus Agile

- Octopus Cosy

- British Gas PeakSave

- Ovo Charge Anytime (EV-based smart tariff)

These tariffs reward customers who can shift usage.

**Best for:**

- people who run appliances at night

- EV owners

- homes with batteries

- flexible households

---

### **4. EV Tariffs**

Designed for electric vehicle owners.

Examples:

- Intelligent Octopus

- OVO Charge Anytime

- E.ON Next Drive

These offer extremely cheap overnight electricity (as low as **7–12p/kWh**).

**Best for:**

- EV owners

- homes charging cars overnight

- households able to shift high usage off-peak

---

### **5. Green Tariffs**

Tariffs that match energy use with renewable generation.

These are more about sustainability than saving money.

---

### **6. Tracker & Dynamic Tariffs**

Prices change daily based on the wholesale market.

Examples:

- Octopus Tracker

- Octopus Agile (half-hourly pricing)

These tariffs can be very cheap — but also very volatile.

**Best for:** informed users who monitor prices

**Worst for:** people needing bill predictability

---

## 3. Understanding the Two Key Costs: Unit Rate & Standing Charge

### **Unit Rate**

- The price you pay per kWh of electricity or gas.

- Varies based on region, supplier, and tariff type.

2025 typical unit rates:

- Electricity: **22–29p/kWh**

- Gas: **5–7p/kWh**

### **Standing Charge**

- Daily fixed fee.

- Paid even if you use no energy.

2025 typical standing charges:

- Electricity: **55–62p/day**

- Gas: **28–31p/day**

Standing charges now make up a large percentage of most bills.

---

## 4. Realistic Tariff Comparison Examples (2025)

Let's compare three realistic households:

### **Scenario A: Standard Family, No EV**

- Annual usage: 3,500 kWh

- Standard variable tariff (SVT): 27p/kWh, 60p/day

**Annual cost:** ~£1,387

**Fixed tariff (25p/kWh, 50p/day):**

**Annual cost:** ~£1,257

**Savings:** ~£130/year

---

### **Scenario B: EV Owner (Charging Daily)**

- Home EV charging: 2,000 kWh/month (24,000 kWh/year)

- Standard tariff cost: 27p/kWh → **£6,480/year**

**EV Tariff (Intelligent Octopus @ ~10p/kWh):**

Annual cost: **£2,400/year**

**Savings:** ~**£4,000+ per year**

---

### **Scenario C: Heat Pump Home**

Heat pumps use 3,000–6,000 extra kWh per year.

- Standard tariff: 29p/kWh → expensive

- Smart tariff: shift heating to overnight or off-peak

Smart tariff savings: **£250–£700 per year**

---

## 5. Which Tariff Is Actually the Cheapest?

There is **no universal cheapest tariff** — it depends entirely on your usage pattern:

### For **low-usage households**:

- Avoid high standing charges

- Fixed tariffs often cheaper

### For **EV owners**:

- Intelligent Octopus / Ovo Anytime → unbeatable

### For **heat pump homes**:

- Smart tariffs with off-peak windows

### For **WFH households**:

- Avoid peak-based tariffs

- Fixed tariffs are more stable

### For **night owls / shift workers**:

- Agile, Cosy, or EV tariffs can cut costs massively

---

## 6. Common Mistakes When Choosing Tariffs

### **Mistake 1: Choosing a tariff based on someone else's bill**

Your usage pattern is unique.

### **Mistake 2: Ignoring standing charges**

A low unit rate with a very high standing charge can be more expensive.

### **Mistake 3: Overestimating usage shifts**

Some households overestimate their ability to run appliances at night.

### **Mistake 4: Staying on SVT out of convenience**

SVT is rarely the cheapest option.

---

## 7. How Smart Tariffs Work in Practice

Smart tariffs rely on:

- smart meter half-hourly data

- automated scheduling

- real-time pricing

- appliance / EV automation

The goal is simple:

**Reward users who use energy when the grid is cheap & clean.**

EV charging, heating, and dishwashing become cheaper at off-peak times.

## 8. How the Cost Saver App Helps You Choose the Best Tariff

Your app uses real household usage to calculate:

### ✔ Your cheapest tariff

Based on your actual hourly or monthly patterns.

### ✔ Personalized tariff savings

Shows how much you’d pay on each tariff.

### ✔ EV charging cost modelling

Compares day vs night charging.

### ✔ Heat pump compatibility

Shows if your heating pattern suits off-peak tariffs.

### ✔ Real-time bill forecasting

Predicts next month’s cost under each tariff.

### ✔ Regional pricing differences

Because prices differ between postcodes.

This turns the confusing UK tariff landscape into a simple, personalised decision.

- understand their usage

- compare personalised tariff options

- avoid expensive SVTs

- maximise smart tariff savings

In a world of rising costs, choosing the right tariff is one of the most powerful tools households have — and now, it’s easier than ever.
