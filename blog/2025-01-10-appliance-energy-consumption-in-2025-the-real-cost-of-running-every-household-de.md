# Appliance Energy Consumption in 2025: The Real Cost of Running Every Household Device (Complete UK Guide)

Most UK households have no idea which appliances are quietly eating into their energy bill. With electricity prices still high in 2025 (22–29p per kWh), even small inefficiencies can add £200–£400 per year in wasted energy. This guide reveals the *real running cost* of common household appliances, explains which devices use the most electricity, offers practical ways to reduce consumption, and shows how the Cost Saver App helps you track usage and avoid bill spikes.

## 1. Why Appliance Energy Consumption Matters More in 2025

UK energy bills remain heavily driven by electricity usage, especially as homes adopt:

- air fryers

- gaming PCs

- EV chargers

- electric heaters

- tumble dryers

- heat pumps

- home working setups

Even efficient appliances can cost more than expected if used during peak times.

**Key reason:**

Electricity is now 3–5× more expensive per kWh than gas.

---

## 2. The Appliances That Use the Most Electricity (Ranked)

### 🔥 **1. Electric Heaters (Worst Offender)**

Cost: **£1.60–£2.10 per hour**

(2kW heater × 27p per kWh)

Using one for 4 hours per day → **£190/month**

---

### 🚗 **2. EV Charging**

Home charging is cheap *only with smart tariffs*.

- Standard tariff (27p/kWh):

Full charge (50 kWh) → **£13.50**

- EV tariff (10p/kWh):

Full charge → **£5.00**

If you charge 3 times per week:

- Standard tariff → £162/month

- Smart tariff → £60/month

---

### 🧺 **3. Tumble Dryer**

One of the most expensive appliances.

- Heat pump dryer: **20–40p per cycle**

- Condenser dryer: **50–70p per cycle**

3 loads per week → £6–£9/month.

---

### 🏠 **4. Electric Showers**

9kW shower × 10 mins/day:

Cost: **~£12–£16/month per person**

A family of four → **£50–£60/month**

---

### ❄️ **5. Fridge-Freezer**

Always running.

Typical cost: **£5–£9/month**

Older models: **£12–£15/month**

This is the most consistent long-term user.

---

### 🍳 **6. Oven**

Electric oven: **60–90p per hour**

Using it 1 hour/day → £18–£27/month.

Air fryers cost **6–8× less**.

---

### 💻 **7. Gaming PCs & Multi-Monitor Setups**

A gaming PC can draw **300–700W**.

2 hours/day: **£5–£12/month**

Heavy use gamers: **£20–£40/month**

Monitors add another **£2–£4/month**.

---

### 📺 **8. TVs & Entertainment Systems**

Typical cost: **£3–£7/month**

Large OLEDs can reach **£8–£12/month**.

Streaming boxes draw 3–10W idle.

---

### 🧼 **9. Washing Machine**

Per cycle:

- 30°C: **10–20p**

- 60°C: **30–40p**

Cold washes save money without reducing cleaning quality.

---

### 🍽 **10. Dishwasher**

One cycle: **20–40p**

Eco mode saves ~40%.

---

## 3. Appliances That Use Surprisingly *Little* Electricity

### ✔ Air Fryer

One cycle: **10–15p**

Much cheaper than ovens and faster.

### ✔ Microwave

Per use: **3–6p**

### ✔ LED Bulbs

Running an LED bulb for a full month: **~50p**

### ✔ Laptop

1–2 hours/day: **£1–£2/month**

---

## 4. The “Always-On” Vampire Appliances

These consume electricity even when not in use.

- routers

- TVs on standby

- games consoles on standby

- smart speakers

- chargers

- washing machines in idle mode

Vampire load cost: **£6–£15/month** for a typical home.

Smart plugs can reduce this significantly.

---

## 5. How Much Electricity Does the *Average* UK Home Use?

Typical annual consumption:

- Low usage: **1,800–2,200 kWh**

- Medium usage: **2,900–3,800 kWh**

- High usage: **4,500–7,000 kWh**

Much of this depends on:

- number of occupants

- heating method

- appliance type

- working-from-home patterns

- EV ownership

---

## 6. How to Reduce Appliance Costs Without Sacrificing Comfort

### ✔ Run appliances during off-peak hours

Smart tariffs can cut costs by 30–70%.

### ✔ Replace electric heaters with gas or heat pump heating

Electric heaters are extremely expensive to run.

### ✔ Use eco settings

Saves 20–40% energy on washing machines and dishwashers.

### ✔ Avoid peak-time EV charging

Standard tariffs make EV charging extremely costly.

### ✔ Switch to air fryers

Cuts oven usage significantly.

### ✔ Turn off vampire devices

Standby waste adds up.

### ✔ Upgrade old fridge-freezers

One of the few appliances where modern replacements pay off quickly.

---

## 7. Biggest Energy Mistakes UK Homes Make (2025)

- Using tumble dryers unnecessarily

- Heating unused rooms

- Charging EVs during peak times

- Using 60°C washing cycles

- Running full ovens for small meals

- Leaving gaming PCs running all day

- Relying on electric heaters

- Ignoring smart meter spikes

---

## 8. How the Cost Saver App Helps You Identify Appliance Costs

Your app uses smart meter data + patterns to show:

### ✔ Daily and hourly consumption

Identifies spikes that correspond to high-usage appliances.

### ✔ Appliance-level estimation

Detects patterns (e.g., dryer cycles, oven use, EV charging).

### ✔ Personalised “Top Energy Wasters” report

Shows which devices cost the most in *your* home.

### ✔ Off-peak savings recommendations

Suggests the best times to run appliances.

### ✔ EV & heat pump optimisations

Shows how much you’d save on smart tariffs.

### ✔ Monthly bill prediction

Avoids surprise bills from appliance-heavy months.

This is incredibly valuable because smart meters don't label appliances — your app interprets the patterns.
