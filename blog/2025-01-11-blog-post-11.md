Reality: This can actually cost more.
Completely turning off heating allows the home to get very cold. When heating is turned back on, your boiler must work much harder to reach your target temperature.
Maintain steady, moderate heating—especially in winter.
- Lower your thermostat by 1°C
- Use TRVs (radiator valves)
- Heat only occupied rooms
These save 4–7% with no comfort loss.

## 2. Myth: “Electric heaters are cheaper than gas.”
**Reality:** Gas heating is still 3–5× cheaper than electric heating.*

2025 typical prices:
- Gas: ~6p per kWh  
- Electricity: ~27p per kWh  

A 2 kW electric heater costs:
→ **£1.60–£2.10 per hour**

Gas radiators cost:
→ **20–40p per hour**

Electric heaters should only be used in emergencies or in very small, isolated rooms.

---

## 3. Myth: “Keeping the water temperature high reduces boiler effort.”
**Reality:** High hot-water temperatures waste energy.

Set your cylinder to **50–55°C**.  
Higher settings:
- waste gas  
- increase heat loss from pipes  
- add £40–£70 a year to bills  

---

## 4. Myth: “Solar panels don’t work in the UK because the weather is too cloudy.”
**Reality:** Solar works extremely well in the UK.

Modern panels generate electricity even on grey days.  
Typical UK solar yield:
- Scotland: 700–900 kWh/kW  
- South England: 950–1,100 kWh/kW  

A 4 kW system can generate:
→ **3,200–4,400 kWh per year**

Solar has one of the best long-term ROIs for UK homes, especially with EVs.

---

## 5. Myth: “Smart meters increase your bills.”
**Reality:** Smart meters only *measure* usage. They cannot increase prices.

What *does* happen:
- You see your real usage (so spikes become obvious)  
- Estimated billing disappears  
- Tariff switching becomes easier  

Smart meters help you understand waste. They don’t cause it.

---

## 6. Myth: “It’s cheaper to heat with the oven or hob.”
**Reality:** Using the oven as a heater is dangerous and extremely expensive.

Electric oven cost:
→ **60–90p per hour**

Gas hob cost:
→ **20–30p per hour + high safety risk**

Use proper heating instead.

---

## 7. Myth: “Dishwashers waste water and energy.”
**Reality:** Modern dishwashers use far less water and energy than hand washing.

Eco mode:  
→ **0.6–1.0 kWh per cycle**  
Cost: **15–25p**

Hand washing can use 5–10× more hot water.

Running a dishwasher every other day costs:
→ **£3–£6 per month**

Very efficient.

---

## 8. Myth: “Leaving appliances on standby doesn’t matter.”
**Reality:** Standby electricity—known as vampire load—costs UK homes £6–£15 per month.

Worst offenders:
- consoles  
- TVs  
- smart speakers  
- routers  
- microwaves  
- chargers left plugged in  

Using smart plugs reduces wasted energy significantly.

---

## 9. Myth: “A bigger boiler heats your home faster.”
**Reality:** Boiler size doesn’t affect heating speed.

Oversized boilers:
- reduce efficiency  
- short-cycle  
- cost more to run  

Boiler size should match the property, not heating speed expectations.

---

## 10. Myth: “Double glazing alone will dramatically cut your bill.”
**Reality:** Double glazing helps, but insulation matters far more.

Heat-loss breakdown:
- Roof: 25–30%  
- Walls: 25%  
- Floors: 10%  
- Windows: 10–15%  

Upgrading glazing saves **£80–£150/year**,  
while loft insulation saves **£150–£250/year**.

---

## 11. Myth: “Air fryers are just a trend—they don’t save money.”
**Reality:** Air fryers are significantly more energy-efficient.

Cost:
- Air fryer: **10–15p per use**
- Oven: **60–90p per hour**

Using an air fryer daily can save £10–£20 per month.

---

## 12. Myth: “Running appliances overnight is dangerous.”
**Reality:** Modern appliances are designed for unattended operation.

What *is* dangerous:
- old appliances  
- blocked filters (dryer fire risk)  
- counterfeit chargers  

Smart tariffs reward off-peak usage safely.

---

## 13. Myth: “Heat pumps don’t work in cold UK weather.”
**Reality:** Modern heat pumps work down to –15°C.

COP (efficiency rating) does reduce in freezing conditions, but heat pumps still outperform boilers in well-insulated homes.

Major savings come from:
- cheap overnight tariffs  
- solar integration  
- steady heating  

---

## 14. Myth: “It’s not worth switching tariffs—you won’t save much.”
**Reality:** Tariff switching is one of the *biggest* ways to save money.

Examples:
- EV tariffs can cut charging costs by 70%  
- Fixed tariffs can beat SVT by £200–£300/year  
- Smart tariffs reward off-peak usage  

A wrong tariff can cost a household **£500–£1,500 a year**.

---

## 15. Myth: “You must heat the whole home to avoid damp.”
**Reality:** Damp is caused by moisture + poor ventilation, not low heat.

Correct approach:
- ventilate daily  
- run extractor fans  
- avoid drying clothes indoors  
- maintain stable heating, not high heating  

Heating unused rooms wastes energy.

---

## 16. Myth: “Solar batteries don’t save money.”
**Reality:** Batteries significantly increase solar value.

Because:
- you use more of your own energy  
- evening usage becomes nearly free  
- EV charging becomes cheaper  
- smart tariffs reduce top-up cost  

Savings increase by **30–60%** with a battery.

---

## 17. Myth: “You shouldn’t wash clothes at 30°C because it’s ineffective.”
**Reality:** Modern detergents work perfectly at low temperatures.

Washing at 30°C saves **20–40%** energy per cycle.
